# Bank_Marketing_Python

## A financial institution (“The Bank”) in Portugal has adopted a marketing strategy - contacting current and prospective customers over the telephone, to sell a new product called Bank Term Deposit.

## The Bank has previously established contacts with 4, 521 of these prospective customers, and it turned out that only about 12% of them purchased or subscribed. The bank understands that not every one of the customers will subscribe the Term Deposit, and does not want to invest campaign resources on those who are not likely to subscribe.

## This project has three goals. To create a model that can:
## •	minimize the cost of making random contacts with current and prospective customers, 
## •	target only customers who are likely to subscribe, 
## •	and, maximize the sale of the Term Deposit.
